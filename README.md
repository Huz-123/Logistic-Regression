Logistic Regression: Insurance Purchase Prediction
Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer purchases insurance, based on features such as age and other relevant attributes. The complete machine learning workflow is captured in both code and a detailed flowchart for educational and operational clarity.

Workflow: Step-by-Step
The process follows standard supervised learning methodology for binary classification with logistic regression:

Start

Import & Load Data

Import required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).

Load the dataset into a DataFrame.

Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Display data samples and check for missing values.

Clean and preprocess data as necessary.

Feature Selection & Splitting

Choose relevant features and define the target variable.

Separate features (X) and labels (y).

Model Training

Initialize and fit a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.

Prediction (Probability Output)

The model computes the probability of the target outcome for each sample:

Linear combination:  z = w₁x₁ + ... + wₙxₙ + b

Apply sigmoid (logistic) function: p = 1 / (1 + e^(–z))

p is the estimated probability of the target being 1.

Thresholding (Logical Decision)

Compare predicted probability to a threshold (commonly 0.5).

If p ≥ 0.5 → Classify as 1 (“Yes”, bought insurance)

If p < 0.5 → Classify as 0 (“No”, did not buy insurance)

Model Evaluation

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

End

Flowchart
The following flowchart visualizes the entire pipeline and highlights the key logical decision point where probability transforms into a yes/no output.

Professional Tips:

The flowchart clearly distinguishes between continuous output (probability) and binary decision (yes/no/purchase).

The workflow reflects best practices and is easy to adapt for other binary classification tasks.
